#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and scalable, meeting user needs and industry standards. In the technology world, software engineering is crucial because it drives innovation, powers applications and systems, and ensures that technology solutions are robust and maintainable, enabling businesses and society to function effectively.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the 1960s, software engineering was introduced as a disciplined approach to coding, emphasizing clear, linear control flow with the use of loops, conditionals, and subroutines.Advent of structured programming in the 1970s

Development of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the 1980s
OOP revolutionized software design by organizing code into reusable objects, each representing real-world entities with attributes and behaviors allowing developers to build complex systems with more manageable and reusable code.

Agile Methodology (2001):
The Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible, iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery of functional software.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning: This phase involves gathering requirements, defining the project scope, and identifying resources. It sets the foundation by outlining the project’s objectives, timeline, and budget.

2. Analysis: In this phase, detailed requirements are collected and analyzed to ensure they align with the business needs. Functional and technical specifications are defined to guide the design and development.

3. Design: The design phase focuses on creating the architecture of the software. This includes system design, database design, and user interface design, providing a blueprint for development.

4. Development: During the development phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers write the code based on the design documents, building the software’s core functionality.

5. Testing: The testing phase involves evaluating the software for defects and verifying that it meets the specified requirements. This includes various testing levels such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

6. Deployment: Once testing is complete and the software is approved, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase includes installing, configuring, and launching the software for users.

7. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues, and updates or enhancements are made as needed to ensure the software continues to function correctly and meets evolving user needs.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
